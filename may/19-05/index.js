// 2. Create Grid
// Create a function called "createGrid", which returns a grid of a 2D array by accepting two arguments: size (which determines the number of nested arrays and the number of elements in each nested array) and char (which determines the characters in each nested array). Print your solution to the console.
// Create Grid Function Call

// createGrid(3, "*")
// Expected Output

// [["*", "*", "*"],
//  ["*", "*", "*"],
//  ["*", "*", "*"]]

// Classes
// Create a blueprint for a course at DCI - using the class syntax in javascript. The class should be named "Course" The class should contain who the teacher is, whether the group is learning marketing or web development and the number of students taking the course.
// The class should also have a method named "spaceNeeded" that checks how big a classroom should be depending on the number of students taking the course: 1 student = 2m². E.g. If a course has 10 students, then print: "The classroom should be 20m².". Print your solution to the console.
// Create a method named "details" to print all the information of the course: "This is a web development course taught by John Smith. There are 10 students taking the course.". Print your solution to the console.
// Note: Please use the phrases found in the instructions above and just change the output depending on the teacher, course, number of students etc.
// Expected Output

// course.spaceNeeded();
// `The classroom should be 44m².`

// course.details();
// `This is a web development course taught by John. There are 22 students taking the course.`
// Problem Solving
// 1. Format your string
// Write function named "capitalizeFirstLetter" that accepts a string as an argument. The function should convert the first character of each word to uppercase. Example the quick brown fox → The Quick Brown Fox. Print your solution to the console.
// Expected Output
