// You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!

// Write a function named calculateDogAge that:
// takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
// calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
// outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"
// Call the function three times with different sets of values.
// Bonus: Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years.

// outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"

// The Temperature Converter
// It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

// Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:

// Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
// Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:

// Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
